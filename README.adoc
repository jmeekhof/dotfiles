Keep your configurations organized and source controlled.

== Use
This takes advantage of https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow] in order
to create symbolic links from this repo to where the config files are expected
to be located. This is handy because it gives me one repository to manage
without writing complicated scripts to put the files where they belong.

The inspiration for this repository was obtained from
http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html[this
article].



[source,shell]
----
stow --dotfiles nvim

This would sym link all the configs necessary for nvim in the appropriate places.
